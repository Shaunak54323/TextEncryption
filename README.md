# Playfair Cipher:
The Playfair cipher uses a 5×5 grid of letters, and encrypts a message by breaking the text into pairs of letters and swapping them according to their positions. The cipher is then encoded by replacing each letter with the letter in the same row or column that is not in the same row or column as the original letter. The cipher is then encoded by replacing each letter with the letter in the same row or column that is not in the same row or column as the original letter.

# Hill Cipher:
The Hill cipher is a form of transposition cipher, in which the letters of a message are replaced by numbers, and the numbers are multiplied by a key matrix. The result is then summed modulo 26. The key matrix is a square matrix of size n, and the message is a matrix of size n×m. The ciphertext is then a matrix of size n×m. The key matrix is a square matrix of size n, and the message is a matrix of size n×m. The ciphertext is then a matrix of size n×m.

# Vigenère Cipher:
Vigenère cipher is a form of polyalphabetic substitution cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter in a different position in a keyword. The keyword is then used to encrypt the plaintext. The keyword is a string of letters, and the plaintext is a string of letters. The ciphertext is then a string of letters. The keyword is a string of letters, and the plaintext is a string of letters. The ciphertext is then a string of letters.

# Vernam Cipher: {Working on it}
Very similar to the Vigenère cipher, except that the keyword is a random sequence of bits. The plaintext is a string of bits, and the ciphertext is a string of bits. The keyword is a string of bits, and the plaintext is a string of bits. The ciphertext is then a string of bits. The keyword is a string of bits, and the plaintext is a string of bits. The ciphertext is then a string of bits. The keyword is a string of bits, and the plaintext is a string of bits. The ciphertext is then a string of bits.

# Single Letter Frequency Attack: {Working on it}
In cryptography, a single-letter frequency attack is a type of cryptanalysis technique that uses statistical analysis to break a ciphertext that has been encrypted with a single-character key. The ciphertext is a string of letters, and the key is a single letter. The ciphertext is then a string of letters. The key is a single letter. The ciphertext is then a string of letters. The key is a single letter. The ciphertext is then a string of letters.
